## Progress notes
Got sick Thursday, 5/18. Didn't exercise 5/18 - 5/20. Decided to repeat week 3 and push the training block forward by a week, ending July 16th instead of July 9th.

Front Squat feels easier than OH press. I think when I test next block I'll see a substantially higher front squat.

Left knee pain is back, particularly exacerbated by front squat.

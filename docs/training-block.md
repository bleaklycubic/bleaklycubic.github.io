# Previous Training Blocks

## May - June 2023
### Notes
Volume was a little higher than I could handle I think. Was pretty worn out toward the end. 

Weights didn't feel terribly heavy at any point though.

Got sick and had to repeat week three, so turned into a 7 week block.

Added in some deadlifting and weighted carries near the end.

Rarely actually did 100 swings.
